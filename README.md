# BioContainers for training
Here we present a base specification and guidelines in using bioinformatics containers for training purposes, including examples. 

The different topics are:
- [Galaxy container](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/BioContainers_for_training/tree/master/Galaxy_container) - Automatic workflow loading and execution inside a galaxy container
- [Galaxy training container](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/BioContainers_for_training/tree/master/Galaxy_training_container) - Creating a new galaxy training container
- [Nextflow container](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/BioContainers_for_training/tree/master/Nextflow_container) - Running Nextflow inside containers


## Containers
Containers enable a common and controllable environment for running software and deals with some of the current problems during software development and distribution including dependencies and multiplatform usage.
